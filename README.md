## 📌 About the Game
**Rock-Paper-Scissors** is a classic hand game played between two opponents. Each player selects **rock**, **paper**, or **scissors**, and the winner is determined based on simple rules:
- **Rock** beats **Scissors** (rock crushes scissors).
- **Scissors** beats **Paper** (scissors cut paper).
- **Paper** beats **Rock** (paper covers rock).
- If both players choose the same option, it's a **tie**.

## 🏆 Project Goals
This project brings the game to life in Python, allowing users to play against a computer opponent with randomized moves.

## 🛠 Solution Approach
I solved this problem using:
- **Algorithms:** Random choice for computer moves, comparison-based winner logic.
- **Technology:** Python.
- **Libraries:** "random" (for computer move selection).
