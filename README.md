# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game by Ruben ðŸŽ® 

## Project Goals
This project implements a simple **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game where a player competes against a computer. The goal is to provide a fun, interactive way to practice basic Python programming while understanding the game logic.

## Solution
I solved this problem using:
- **Algorithms:** Random choice for computer moves, comparison-based winner logic.
- **Technology:** Python.
- **Libraries:** "random" (for computer move selection).
